App name: in the works

Description: 
An online social network that helps people find and connect with others who have similar interests. Find or create events based on the user's hobbies, lifestyle, or passions, such as local hangouts, community activities, or group meetups.

Using categories and keywords, the app helps users discover nearby gatherings, such as sports games, study groups, music sessions, or casual get-togethers. Detailed information about each event, including the date, time, location, and participant limit, allows users to RSVP, comment, and communicate with others.
